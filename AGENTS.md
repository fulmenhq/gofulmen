# Gofulmen – AI Agents Startup Guide

## 🔑 Read First

- **Prioritize Quality and Reliability**: As the Go foundation library for the FulmenHQ ecosystem, designed for extremely high-scale enterprise-class applications, all actions must emphasize code quality, test coverage, and API stability. Our goal is not rapid commits but ensuring correctness to enable scalable, maintainable Go applications. Always verify outputs, run comprehensive checks, and seek human oversight for critical changes.
- Confirm your agentic interface. If the session does not name an interface adapter (e.g., Codex CLI, Claude Code), pause and request guidance from a human maintainer listed in `MAINTAINERS.md` before taking action.
- Do not assume an agentic identity. Agent identities are assigned in `MAINTAINERS.md`. Request assignment if none is provided.
- Review `REPOSITORY_SAFETY_PROTOCOLS.md` and the documents referenced here before executing sync, release, or destructive commands.

Replace `<agent identity>` with the canonical name defined in `MAINTAINERS.md` (e.g., `Foundation Forge`).

**Project**: gofulmen  
**Purpose**: Go foundation library for FulmenHQ ecosystem – Providing enterprise-grade Go packages for configuration, logging, schema validation, and developer tooling.  
**Governance**: 3leaps Initiative

## Agent Identities

Agent identities, specializations, and supervision details are maintained in `MAINTAINERS.md`. Refer to that file for the current roster of AI co-maintainers.

## Commit Attribution

**DO**: Follow the standard attribution format and concise commit message style
- Attribution format: [`docs/crucible-go/standards/agentic-attribution.md`](docs/crucible-go/standards/agentic-attribution.md)
- Message style: [Repository Operations SOP - Commit Message Style](docs/crucible-go/sop/repository-operations-sop.md#commit-message-style)
- Quick style check: [Style Checklist](docs/crucible-go/sop/repository-operations-sop.md#quick-style-check)

**Required trailers for commits**:

1. Generated by line with interface link and human supervisor
2. `Co-Authored-By:` trailer with agent email
3. `Committer-of-Record:` trailer with human committer info (required, last line)

**DO NOT**:
- Use simplified or incomplete attribution formats
- Use excessive emoji sections in commit messages ([see what to avoid](docs/crucible-go/sop/repository-operations-sop.md#avoid---excessive-emoji-sections))
- Write verbose internal documentation style in commits (belongs in code comments, docs/, or ADRs)

**Example** (using Claude Code interface with Foundation Forge identity):

```
fix: resolve bootstrap symlink creation for type:link tools

The installLink() function was copying files instead of creating symlinks
for type:link installations, causing bin/goneat to become stale after
source rebuilds. Now properly uses os.Symlink() per filepath best practices.

Verified: bin/goneat is now a symlink that tracks source automatically.

Generated by Foundation Forge ([Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)) under supervision of @3leapsdave

Co-Authored-By: Foundation Forge <noreply@3leaps.net>
Committer-of-Record: Dave Thompson <dave.thompson@3leaps.net> [@3leapsdave]
```

See [`docs/crucible-go/standards/agentic-attribution.md`](docs/crucible-go/standards/agentic-attribution.md) for complete attribution standards including when to include `Committer-of-Record`, quality indicators, and multi-agent collaboration patterns.

## Session Startup Protocol

1. **Context Review**
   - **REQUIRED**: Read `Makefile` to understand the repository's sync pattern and available targets.
   - Read `MAINTAINERS.md`, `REPOSITORY_SAFETY_PROTOCOLS.md`, and relevant package READMEs under `ascii/`, `logging/`, `config/`, `schema/`, `pathfinder/`, `bootstrap/`, `crucible/`.
   - Review synced Crucible standards in `docs/crucible-go/standards/` (especially coding/go.md, observability/logging.md, library module standards).
   - **CRITICAL**: Understand that `docs/crucible-go/`, `schemas/crucible-go/`, and `config/crucible-go/` are synced FROM Crucible SSOT via `make sync`.
2. **Environment Check**
   - Confirm required tools (`go >= 1.21`, `goneat`) are available if commands will be executed.
   - Run `make bootstrap` if tools are missing.
3. **Plan**
   - Outline steps in `.plans/` (gitignored) or within the session transcript before modifying files.
4. **Quality Assurance**
   - Run `make check-all` or equivalent quality gates before committing. Analyze outputs thoroughly; do not proceed if checks fail. Prioritize fixing process issues over code changes.
   - Ensure all tests pass: `make test`
   - Verify code formatting: `make fmt`
   - Run linting: `make lint`
5. **Execute Safely**
   - Use prescribed Make targets: `make bootstrap`, `make sync`, `make test`, `make fmt`, `make lint`
   - Follow Go best practices and idioms
   - Maintain backward compatibility for library consumers
6. **Attribution**
   - Follow [Agentic Attribution Standard](docs/crucible-go/standards/agentic-attribution.md) for commit messages and PRs.
7. **Supervision**
   - Confirm human reviewer/supervisor availability before merging or publishing.

## Operational Guidelines

### DO

- **Quality First**: Always run `make check-all` before commits. Analyze all outputs; resolve process failures before code fixes.
- **Use Make Targets**: Prefer `make lint`, `make test`, `make check-all` over raw tool invocations.
- **Follow Go Standards**: Adhere to `docs/crucible-go/standards/coding/go.md` for code style and patterns.
- **Maintain Test Coverage**: Add tests for all new functionality; maintain existing coverage levels.
- **Sync Before Changes**: Run `make sync` to get latest Crucible assets before making changes.
- **Document APIs**: Provide godoc comments for all exported functions, types, and packages.
- **Use Semantic Versioning**: Follow version management via `make version-bump-{patch|minor|major}`.
- **Verify Bootstrap**: Test bootstrap process after changes to bootstrap/ package.

### DO NOT

- **Edit Synced Files**: NEVER manually edit files in `docs/crucible-go/`, `schemas/crucible-go/`, or `config/crucible-go/` - these are synced FROM Crucible SSOT via `make sync`. If changes are needed:
  1. Create `.plans/crucible/<YYYYMMDD>/` directory
  2. Save proposed changes there for Crucible team review
  3. Reset the synced files: `git checkout -- docs/crucible-go schemas/crucible-go config/crucible-go`
  4. After Crucible team updates, run `make sync` to get changes
- **Commit Planning Files**: Never attempt to commit files in `.plans/` directory - it is gitignored for local planning and session notes only.
- **Break API Compatibility**: Gofulmen is a library - breaking changes require major version bump and migration guide.
- **Skip Tests**: Never commit code without passing tests. Run `make test` before every commit.
- **Ignore Linting**: All code must pass `make lint` before commit.
- **Commit Without Formatting**: Run `make fmt` before every commit.
- **Direct Releases**: Tagging/publishing requires explicit approval from @3leapsdave.
- **Store Secrets**: Never commit API keys, tokens, or credentials. See `REPOSITORY_SAFETY_PROTOCOLS.md`.
- **Modify VERSION Directly**: Use `make version-bump-{patch|minor|major}` or `make version-set VERSION=x.y.z`.
- **Skip Bootstrap Verification**: After bootstrap/ changes, always test with `make bootstrap` and `make tools`.
