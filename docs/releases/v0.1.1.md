# Release Notes - gofulmen v0.1.1

**Release Date**: October 14, 2025
**Release Type**: Feature Release - Foundry Module Complete
**Status**: ✅ Ready for Release

## Overview

Version 0.1.1 adds the **Foundry** package - a comprehensive set of enterprise-grade foundation utilities built from Crucible catalogs. This release also improves test coverage to exceed the 50% threshold required for the v0.1.x series.

## Features

### Foundry Package (Complete)

Enterprise-grade foundation utilities providing consistent cross-language implementations from Crucible catalogs:

#### Time Utilities

- **RFC3339Nano timestamps** with nanosecond precision
- Cross-language compatible time formatting
- `UTCNowRFC3339Nano()`, `FormatRFC3339Nano()`, `ParseRFC3339Nano()`

#### Correlation IDs

- **UUIDv7** time-sortable correlation IDs for distributed tracing
- Globally unique, time-ordered identifiers
- `GenerateCorrelationID()`, `MustGenerateCorrelationID()`, `ParseCorrelationID()`, `IsValidCorrelationID()`

#### Pattern Matching

- 20+ curated patterns from Crucible catalogs (email, slug, UUID, semver, etc.)
- Support for regex, glob, and literal pattern types
- `Match()`, `MustMatch()`, `Search()`, `CompiledRegex()`
- Pattern categories: ANSI, Domain, Path, Version Control, Security

#### MIME Type Detection

- Content-based detection with magic number sniffing
- Extension-based lookup for common file types
- Support for JSON, YAML, XML, CSV, plain text, and more
- `DetectMimeType()`, `GetMimeTypeByExtension()`, `IsSupportedMimeType()`

#### HTTP Status Helpers

- Status code grouping (1xx-5xx)
- Validation helpers (`IsSuccess()`, `IsClientError()`, `IsServerError()`)
- Reason phrase lookup (`GetReasonPhrase()`)
- `NewHTTPStatusHelper()`, `GetGroup()`, `Contains()`

#### Country Code Validation

- ISO 3166-1 support (Alpha-2, Alpha-3, Numeric)
- Case-insensitive lookups with normalization
- 249 countries with full metadata
- `GetCountry()`, `GetCountryByAlpha3()`, `ValidateCountryCode()`, `ListCountries()`

#### Catalog System

- Singleton global catalog with embedded data
- Offline operation (no network dependencies)
- Type-safe access via `GetDefaultCatalog()`
- Convenience functions: `GetPattern()`, `GetMimeType()`, `GetHTTPStatusHelper()`

**Test Coverage**: 85.8% (86 passing tests)

### Test Improvements

Significant test coverage improvements across core packages:

#### Schema Package

- **Before**: 9.9% coverage
- **After**: 53.5% coverage
- **Improvement**: +43.6 percentage points
- New tests:
  - `LoadJSONFile()`, `LoadYAMLFile()`, `LoadSchemaFile()`, `LoadSchemaFromDir()`
  - `ParseJSON()` with various data formats
  - `ValidationError`, `ValidationErrors`, `NewValidationError()`
  - Test fixtures for JSON/YAML schema loading

#### Logging Package

- **Before**: 50.8% coverage
- **After**: 54.2% coverage
- **Improvement**: +3.4 percentage points
- New tests:
  - All logging level methods (Trace, Debug, Info, Warn, Error)
  - `Named()` - named logger creation
  - `WithContext()` - context-aware logging

#### Overall Coverage

- **Before**: 49.6%
- **After**: 52.1%
- **Improvement**: +2.5 percentage points
- **Status**: ✅ Exceeds 50% threshold for v0.1.x series

## Breaking Changes

None - fully backward compatible with v0.1.0.

## Migration Notes

No migration required. This release adds new functionality without modifying existing APIs.

### Upgrading from v0.1.0

```bash
go get -u github.com/fulmenhq/gofulmen@v0.1.1
```

## Known Limitations

### Cloud Storage (Deferred)

Cloud storage abstractions (S3, Azure Blob, GCS) were deferred pending ecosystem-wide discussion. See `.plans/roadmap/cloud-storage-deferral.md` for details.

**Rationale**: Cloud storage is an Extension tier feature (not Core), and requires cross-library design discussion to ensure consistency across gofulmen, pyfulmen, and tsfulmen.

**Timeline**: To be evaluated for v0.2.0+ after cross-library maintainer discussion.

## Dependencies

All dependencies remain stable from v0.1.0:

- **Go**: 1.21+
- **Crucible**: 2025.10.2
- External packages:
  - `github.com/google/uuid` (for UUIDv7 generation)
  - `github.com/santhosh-tekuri/jsonschema/v6` (for schema validation)
  - `go.uber.org/zap` (for structured logging)
