# Gofulmen v0.1.12 Release Notes

**Release Date**: 2025-11-10  
**Release Type**: Bug Fix  
**Status**: ✅ Ready for Release

## Overview

This release fixes a critical oversight where `go.mod` still referenced `crucible v0.2.8` despite the v0.1.11 release documenting the sync to v0.2.9. Downstream teams were reporting incorrect crucible versions when consuming gofulmen.

## Changes

### Dependency Fix

- **Updated go.mod**: Changed `github.com/fulmenhq/crucible v0.2.8` to `v0.2.9`
- **Ran go mod tidy**: Ensured consistent dependency resolution throughout the module
- **Resolves downstream issues**: Teams now get correct crucible v0.2.9 as documented in v0.1.11

## Impact

- **No breaking changes**: This is a dependency correction only
- **Downstream compatibility**: Ensures downstream users receive the intended crucible v0.2.9 features
- **Build reproducibility**: Fixes inconsistent dependency resolution across environments

## Verification

- `go.mod` now correctly references `github.com/fulmenhq/crucible v0.2.9`
- `go list -m github.com/fulmenhq/crucible` returns `v0.2.9`
- Downstream teams can now access crucible v0.2.9 schemas and documentation as expected
